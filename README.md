# Smoke-Detection-and-Fire-Prevention
This is an IOT project which detects smoke of our system  
and when it goes greater than a certain level (0.5 in this case)  
then windows and doors opens and water come out from sprinkler.  
Also a siren turns on and we get alerts on our mobile device automatically.  
This project is implemented and tested on packet tracer.
